Tommy's Game TODO List

1. Create logic for portrait images along with dialogue DONE
2. No more fade to black,   
    a. Current scenario turns into an image, zooms out and appears inside of a picture frame
    b. Says "you completed the challenge"
    c. Loads back to scenario   (this all takes place in the GoodEnding logic in the manager)
3. Run through and try to break the game to find bugs

4. Start next scenario (flood)


HOW TO DO #2
Scenes always exist inside a Picture Frame sprite (really just needs to be the last one (leaf node))

Hierarchy looks like:
Picture Frame
    -Sprite Mask (to clip everything inside the picture frame)
        - Scenario Prefab (everything set to visible inside mask)
        - Player (Set to visibible inside mask)




When the ending actually happens
- Spawn the "real world" scene BEHIND the current scene (above it in the hierarchy, or change sort layer)
- Set material, which we can also lerp to black and white
- Scale down the Picture Frame to desired size, revealing "real world"
- Bonus points, Lerp it to a location
- Display, "You Completed Challenge" at the top
- Two buttons appear, RESTART and QUIT



9/9 NOTES
only the player turns gray, have to go into the children of the game prefab too
make the background what tommy wants


9/30 Emulator NOTES

Blue bars on the side show (background sprites aren't wide enough)
Timer text overlaps the buttons
Can't see the "Police" word on the dialogue screen
In the main menu, player's starting position needs to be further to the left. 
Timer overlaps the police

    Google Tablet  
TImer overlaps with buttons


    Pixel Fold  
Too zoomed in, player runs off edge of the screen
