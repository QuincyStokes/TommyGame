Tommy's Game TODO List

1. Create logic for portrait images along with dialogue DONE
2. No more fade to black,   
    a. Current scenario turns into an image, zooms out and appears inside of a picture frame
    b. Says "you completed the challenge"
    c. Loads back to scenario   (this all takes place in the GoodEnding logic in the manager)
3. Run through and try to break the game to find bugs

4. Start next scenario (flood)


HOW TO DO #2
Scenes always exist inside a Picture Frame sprite (really just needs to be the last one (leaf node))

Hierarchy looks like:
Picture Frame
    -Sprite Mask (to clip everything inside the picture frame)
        - Scenario Prefab (everything set to visible inside mask)
        - Player (Set to visibible inside mask)




When the ending actually happens
- Spawn the "real world" scene BEHIND the current scene (above it in the hierarchy, or change sort layer)
- Set material, which we can also lerp to black and white
- Scale down the Picture Frame to desired size, revealing "real world"
- Bonus points, Lerp it to a location
- Display, "You Completed Challenge" at the top
- Two buttons appear, RESTART and QUIT



9/9 NOTES
only the player turns gray, have to go into the children of the game prefab too
make the background what tommy wants


9/30 Emulator NOTES
    Pixel 9
Blue bars on the side show (background sprites aren't wide enough)
Timer text overlaps the buttons
Can't see the "Police" word on the dialogue screen
In the main menu, player's starting position needs to be further to the left. 
Timer overlaps the police

    Google Tablet  
TImer overlaps with buttons


    Pixel Fold  
Too zoomed in, player runs off edge of the screen

Emulator Scores

Pixel 9 : 4.5/10
Google Tablet : 8/10
Pixel Fold : 7.5


FIXES:
Selection screen background change color
fix portrait on Winning scene
Fix closet ending timeline
Fix police screen overlapping timer text





**Have to play fire before flood*

Flood

Where does the player start?
Player is outside, it's raining
	"It's raining so much"
	**The outside is flooding already**
	"I finally got a new house!"

Player goes inside, into their room
	"Thank goodness my new house is stable enough.."
	** This SFX plays **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc9-HJ9Rd4w
	>The house starts filling up with water

There's a time limit, as longer time goes on, it fills up the house.


The room floods quickly
1. Call 911 and try to go outside
    -> Leads you to the living room
    The water floods away your wallet, you have to make a decision
    1. Chase after your wallet
        -> Chase wallet, furniture hits you, you lose

    2. Get to higher ground
        -> Go upstairs, forget the wallet
            Peek outside to see water flowing up, 
        **New Game Mechanic**
        1. You find a ladder to get to the roof
            Player has to spam click to help the user get the ladder up.
            -> If they don't click enough, the game ends.

            -> If they do click enough, they get onto the roof
                Police come in a helicopter, 
                    50/50 CHANCE 	
                        ->lightning strikes the helicopter, spins down into the building, killing everything. 
                        -> Lightning does NOT strike, you make it out alive.
            Game ends, fades to black, Words fade in red with a cool animation.
                "You made all the right decisions, but unfortunately luck wasn't on your side.." 
                
                        


2. Call 911 and stay in your room
    -> Water keeps on filling
    1. Go outside through the window
        -> Water floods your room, you end up in the flood outside
            You lose/die
    2. Go outside the door
        Too much water, can't open it, you have to go try the window, you end up in the flood outside.
            You lose/die.
