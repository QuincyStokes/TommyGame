Tommy's Game TODO List

1. Create logic for portrait images along with dialogue
2. No more fade to black,   
    a. Current scenario turns into an image, zooms out and appears inside of a picture frame
    b. Says "you completed the challenge"
    c. Loads back to scenario   (this all takes place in the GoodEnding logic in the manager)
3. Run through and try to break the game to find bugs

4. Start next scenario (flood)
